# Data Folder
We make all data collected and used in experiments publicly available. Due to the size of the data itself, we host it on Google Drive, rather than in this repo. Please see the data folder below for more information:

[Data Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ad8ISvuebdg0RiE1F0NtgAkJ27sDpZt-?usp=sharing)

However, we also provide access to human study results in the folder `human study data`, which contains both a cleaned and uncleaned version of the data collected from our Prolific study. More details on this study are available at [Prolific experiment setup repo](https://github.com/AdaDTur/prolific-study/).
